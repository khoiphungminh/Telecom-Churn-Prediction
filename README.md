# Telecom-Churn-Prediction
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom sector using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers at high risk of churning by analyzing various behavioral and demographic data points, allowing telecom companies to take proactive measures to retain their customer base.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves cleaning and formatting raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Discovering patterns and insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhancing model performance by creating new relevant features.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Developing predictive models and assessing their effectiveness.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Deploying trained models to forecast customer churn.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Main programming language used.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Providing machine learning algorithms and tools for model evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating informative visualizations.
- **Imbalanced-Learn (imblearn)**: For handling imbalanced datasets.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and documentation.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- K-Means Clustering
